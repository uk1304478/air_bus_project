Project Title:
"SmartFlight: Real-Time Navigation and Risk Management for Aviation"

Problem Statement:
The aviation industry faces significant challenges in ensuring safe and efficient flight navigation due to unavailable GPS signals, adverse weather conditions, noise, electronic failures, and varying pressures. These factors contribute to human errors, delays, and unsafe conditions.

Objective:
To design, develop, and implement a software solution that:

Identifies optimal flight paths considering various challenges.
Provides real-time risk assessments and alternative route suggestions.
Enhances flight safety and efficiency through real-time health metrics tracking based on flight sensor data.
Methodology:
1. Data Collection and Management:

Collect continuous data from APIs like OpenWeatherMap, AviationStack, and FAA NOTAMs.
Store and expose data via structured databases and APIs.
2. Scenario Identification:

Document scenarios based on data, highlighting risks such as adverse weather and electronic failures.
3. Route Planning Algorithm:

Implement the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm to find safe and efficient routes.
4. User Interface and Dashboard:

Develop a user-friendly interface displaying optimal routes, risks, and real-time updates.
5. Real-time Updates and Integration:

Continuously update risk assessments and routes using new data.
Scope of the Solution:
Scalability: Handle multiple flights and varying conditions efficiently.
Usability: Intuitive interface with real-time alerts for pilots and control centers.
Extensibility: Incorporate additional data sources and sensors.
Impact Metrics: Reduce navigation errors, improve flight safety and efficiency, and enhance situational awareness.
Technologies and Tools Used:
Backend: Flask (Python)
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, jQuery
APIs: OpenWeatherMap, AviationStack, FAA NOTAMs
Algorithms: Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)
Database: Structured database exposed via APIs
